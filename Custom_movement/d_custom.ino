/* 
In order to set what position an axis should be you must set the appropriate reqpos[n] variable for the proper axis.
Ex. For axis two to position 200 the code would be reqpos[1] = 200;

In order to make the appropriate axis start moving you must call the appropriate axis move function.
Ex. For axis two to move to the previously defined position the code would be moving(2);

Delays work as usual to add waits between movements.

Custom movement code goes below in the loop statement.
